# FastApi has some advantages:
# - asynchronous/non-blocking i.e. not every request handlers needs to run in its own thread
# and blocks any other executions within the same thread.
# Flask on the other hand is based on WSGI (which is synchronous by default, there is
# also an asynchronous version of WSGI: ASGI)
